Huh, Seams like you want to make your own commands, I will show you how.

First lets add the following code to our skript

```
discord command test:
  prefixes: !
  executable in: guild
  trigger:
    reply with "You have ran the test command!"
```

Now run "!test" in any discord channel (Doesn't work in bot dms, Sadly i cannot put a picture of this here.)

You have a simple "!test" command, Now you can make your own commands using the template above!

**Happy Coding!**
